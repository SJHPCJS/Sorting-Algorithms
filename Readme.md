# Sorting Algorithms

This project is mainly about the sorting algorithm implementation. It contains eight ways of sorting: insertion sorting, bubble sorting, fast sorting (quick sorting), heap sorting, merge sorting, cardinality sorting (radix sorting), select sorting, and shell sorting. All the algorithms are allowed to be used among integers.
